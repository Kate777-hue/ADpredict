# Alzheimer's Disease - Early Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

This project explores the early prediction of Alzheimer's Disease using ensemble machine learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation on a azheimers disease dataset obtained from kaggle, with an emphasis on interpretability and predictive performance.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- Builds baseline models with Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting
- Compares against voting and stacking ensemble models
- Emphasis on early diagnosis based on medical and lifestyle factors
- Built in Python with Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- Designed for reproducibility and educational insights
